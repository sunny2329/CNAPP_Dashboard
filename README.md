## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 14.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) (optional, but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name

3. Install the dependencies

   If you are using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or if you are using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install


## Development

To start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Or if you are using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your app at http://localhost:3000. The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Build

To create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Or if you are using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   
This will output the built files to the 'dist' directory. You can then server these static files with any static file server or deploy them to a hosting platform.
